All the files contain the scattering parameters data calculated for the ports

Kx_SIM:  

The first set of 3D simulations in Lumerical in which the reference planes of the ports in simulation
 are not matched with the design reference planes

Kx_SIM2:

The second set of 3D simulations in Lumerical in which the reference planes of the ports in simulation
 are carefully matched with the design reference planes


Kx_SIM3:

The third set of 3D simulations done with the Lumerical script to import from the fabricated GDS file.
The reference planes are carefully matched.


Kx_2DEIA_SIM3:

The 2D simulations done with the effective index approach using the script.
