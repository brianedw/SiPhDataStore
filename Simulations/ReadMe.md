# Simulation File Descriptions

All the files contain the scattering parameters data calculated for the ports

`Kx_SIM.txt`:  
* The first set of 3D simulations in Lumerical in which the reference planes of the ports in simulation are not matched with the design reference planes

`Kx_SIM2.txt`:
* The second set of 3D simulations in Lumerical in which the reference planes of the ports in simulation are carefully matched with the design reference planes


`Kx_SIM3.txt`:
* The third set of 3D simulations done with the Lumerical script to import from the fabricated GDS file.  The reference planes are carefully matched.


`Kx_2DEIA_SIM3.txt`:
* The 2D simulations done with the effective index approach using the script.

`Kx_SIM4.txt` & `Calx_SIM4.txt`:
* Simulations done with an updated Lumerical script.  Reference planes were placed at the proper location requiring "tails" on each waveguide.  Calibration simulations are also part of the script.
